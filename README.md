# json-to-array

I saved some 2016-17 (and on) salary data from basketball reference into a CSV, then converted it to JSON using http://www.csvjson.com/csv2json (super helpful).

This app grabs the data from the JSON file and puts it into an array.  

Then it sorts that array by team name, and creates a new array, using an <li> entry (with each player's name/team/salary) as each element.
